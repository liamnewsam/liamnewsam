# Hi 

I am new to GitHub, but I hope to learn how to contribute to this community.  
First thing I want to do, is understand how pull-reqeusting works.  

## **About me**
I am an amateur programmer. I taught myself **python** and have used it as my main language.  
My biggest project was a Chess simulator, which I have a repository of.  

And..... I am tired of learning markdown.
